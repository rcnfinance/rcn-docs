    )     
    external returns (uint256 amount) 
    
    
// partial withdraw function interface    
function withdrawPartial(
    bytes32 _id,
    address _to, 
    uint256 _amount  //amount to withdraw
    )  
    external returns (bool success)

### Receiver Address (_to)

### Example

~~~ javascript
// Withdraw example 

previousBalanceOfAddress = await rcnToken.balanceOf(accounts[1]);

// Partial Withdraw
const withdrawTransaction = await debtEngine.withdrawPartial(
    '0x86029ff516bbfe74ad2c96e90a18d9b3e984d2152a10824ab0ee4521ab952728', // Id of the Loan                                       
    accounts[1],                                 // receiver account of the withdrawal amount   
    web3.utils.toWei("20", "ether"),            // Amount to withdraw equal to = '20000000000000000000'
    { from: accounts[1] });                     // sender address Should be authorized  


// funds are transfer to the _to(accounts[1]) address and the balance is updated

// balance of accounts[1]
newBalanceOfAddress = await rcnToken.balanceOf(accounts[1]);

// The newBalanceOfAddress is equal to the previousBalanceOfAddress + withdraw amount

// If previousBalanceOfAddress = 0 the newBalanceOfAddress should be:
newBalanceOfAddress = '20000000000000000000' // the amount withdrawn
